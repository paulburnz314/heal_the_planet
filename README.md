# heal_the_planet
We can heal the planet if we have the collective will.

Hello, this is my first time using github.

I enjoy learning about and using python 3 as well as QGIS and mongodb.

I used to dabble with visual basic and vba.

I long time ago I made a silk screen for a t-shirt that said "Destroy the environment, create jobs now".

I hope that people will invest in the concept of pollution prevention.

Pollution prevention is the concept of no generated waste in the first place.

Invest in reusable plastics instead of single use plastics.

Composting your food waste instead of sending it to a landfill.

Riding your bike instead of driving somewhere.
